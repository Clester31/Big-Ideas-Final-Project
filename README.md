Abstract:

We believe that the best neighborhood to live in is one where it is the safest to drive in. We use and rely on cars to go about our daily lives, whether it be getting to work, going grocery shopping, or meeting up with some friends. For our final project, we wanted to take a look at all the Pittsburgh neighborhoods and see which one has the best driving quality, which is based of numerous factors. We believed that the safest neighborhood to drive in not only has low amounts of traffic, but a low number of fatalities related to car accidents and a plentiful amount of speeding-preventive measures. For our project, we decided to look at average daily car traffic, median age of death, and the number of speed humps within each neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Through this data, we are able to combine data rearding traffic amounts, but we are also able to see how speeding-preventive measures, such as speed humps, can increase the driving quality within a neighborhood.
